## Flask Setup
Perform following setup steps for the Solar System API repo to get started on this Flask project:

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it
1. Install the dependencies
1. Define a `Planet` class with the attributes `id`, `name`, and `description`, and one additional attribute
1. Create a list of `Planet` instances

## Endpoints
Create the following endpoints, with similar functionality presented in the Hello Books API:

1. As a client, I want to send a request to get all existing `planets`, so that I can see a list of `planets`, with their `id`, `name`, `description`, and other data of the `planet`.
2. As a client, I want to send a request to get one existing `planet`, so that I can see the `id`, `name`, `description`, and other data of the `planet`.
